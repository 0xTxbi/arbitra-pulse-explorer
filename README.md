Arbitra Pulse Explorer serves as the frontend for the Arbitra Pulse API — a
robust Stock Sentiment Analysis API I've meticulously built. It is geared to
deliver real-time stock data, sentiment analysis, and personalized user
experiences.

Crafted to streamline my decision-making in financial investments, this UI
interacts seamlessly with the comprehensive API features. It's a personal
project designed to offer an intuitive interface for exploring stock sentiments
efficiently.

## Purpose

empowerment.
